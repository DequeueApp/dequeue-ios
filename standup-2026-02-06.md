## Completed Work

### PR #260 - feat(DEQ-57): Add UI display config for task.aiCompleted event
- **Status:** Created, CI running (macOS build failed, investigating)
- **What:** Added missing UI display configuration for AI task completion events
  - Label: "Task Completed by AI"
  - Icon: `sparkle.magnifyingglass` (AI-themed)
  - Color: indigo (distinct from human completion's purple)
- **Files changed:**
  - TaskDetailView.swift: Added event display config
  - StackHistoryView.swift: Added event display config
- **Note:** Core implementation (event type, service method, payload, tests) already existed
- **Link:** https://github.com/DequeueApp/dequeue-ios/pull/260

### PR #259 - feat(DEQ-58): Add AI delegation status UI
- **Status:** Fixed conditional compilation error, CI running
- **What:** Found and fixed build failure caused by incorrect #if structure
- **Problem:** `floatingBanners` property had `#if os(iOS)` wrapping entire declaration
- **Fix:** Moved `#if` inside property body + added `#else EmptyView()` case
- **Commit:** d49387f
- **Link:** https://github.com/DequeueApp/dequeue-ios/pull/259

### PR #255 - feat(DEQ-50): Add macOS keyboard shortcuts

- **What:** Previous CI failure was testing code from BEFORE Victor's 5:05 AM fix
- **Action:** Pushed empty commit to trigger new CI run
- **Commit:** 0254732
- **Link:** https://github.com/DequeueApp/dequeue-ios/pull/255

## In Progress

- Monitoring CI runs for all three PRs
- PR #260: macOS build failed (investigating)
- PR #259: SwiftLint & claude-review pending
- PR #255: CI starting

## Blockers / Issues

### CI Quota Conservation
- Remembered to run local checks before pushing (per MEMORY.md)
- However, Xcode not configured in dev environment, so relied on SwiftLint only
- Should configure Xcode for local builds to avoid CI burns

### Conditional Compilation Pattern
- Identified recurring issue with `#if os(...)` placement
- Documented pattern in MEMORY.md: #if must be INSIDE property body, not wrapping declaration
- Fixed in PR #259, will check if same issue affects PR #260

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix PR #260 macOS build failure
- [ ] Monitor remaining CI runs
- [ ] Merge passing PRs
- [ ] Check Linear backlog for small tickets
- [ ] Consider starting DEQ-243 (WebSocket streaming) if time permits (4-6h task)
