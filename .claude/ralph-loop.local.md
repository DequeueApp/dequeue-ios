I want you to start on the Linear project Sync Model It is not started yet so please pull it in from Linear, grab the first issue, and start by making a
  PR for it. Make sure there is solid test coverage and update Linear with your approach and what you are doing and do each issue as a separate and isolated
  PR. Please go until you have completed PRs for each of the 4 issues in this project and you have addressed any feedback on the PR and all CI checks are
  green for each of the 4. When complete:
- All 4 PRs have been created
- All 4 PRs have had their Claude PR feedback addressed
- All 4 PRs are passing all CI checks successfully
- All 4 Linear issues have been updated with the approach and linked to the PRs
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
